# Storage Management System

This is a web-based storage management solution to organise the hardware-items and consumables in my workshop.

## Features

**The application provides the following functionalities:**

- Keep information about the location and specification of hw items and consumables
- Keep an inventory of all the storage locations and boxes
- Enable indications for reordering and also keeps the track of ordering links
- Allows searching for items in the inventory
- Provides label printing capabilities to easily label bins and storage boxes

**The application will provide:**

- Provides functionalities to organise and check bill of materials for projects

**What the application does not provide:**

- Tracking the exact numbers of the items in the system (I simply do not need it at that level of granularity)
- Finding the physical boxes and bins in the workshop
- Keep track of Filaments for 3d printing (I use [spoolman][spoolman] for this)
- Keep detail track of electronic parts (I use [partsbox][partsbox] for this)

**For now - maybe later:**

- Integration into [spoolman][spoolman]
- Integration into [partsbox][partsbox]
